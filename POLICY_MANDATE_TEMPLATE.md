# Brokerage Policy Mandate

## Transaction System of Record & Closing Governance

---

### **Policy Title**

Transaction Governance, Closing Readiness, and System of Record Policy

### **Effective Date**

[Insert Date]

### **Applies To**

All brokers, associate brokers, licensed agents, transaction coordinators, and brokerage staff involved in real estate transactions conducted under the authority of **[Brokerage Name]**.

---

## **I. Purpose and Rationale**

The purpose of this policy is to establish a single, authoritative **Transaction System of Record** for all real estate transactions conducted by **[Brokerage Name]**.

This policy is adopted to:

* Reduce transaction risk and failed closings
* Improve closing predictability and transparency
* Ensure consistent compliance with legal, regulatory, and fiduciary obligations
* Provide clear accountability and auditability across all transactions
* Protect agents, clients, and the brokerage

After evaluation of available systems, **RealEstate-OS** has been designated as the firm's official Transaction System of Record.

---

## **II. Designation of System of Record**

Effective as of the date above:

> **RealEstate-OS is the sole authoritative system for recording, governing, and validating the status of real estate transactions conducted by this brokerage.**

While other tools (CRMs, MLS platforms, email, document storage systems) may continue to be used for communication or marketing purposes, they are **not authoritative** with respect to transaction status, closing readiness, or compliance determinations.

---

## **III. Scope of Required Use**

All transactions under this brokerage's license must be recorded and maintained within RealEstate-OS, including but not limited to:

* Contract execution and acceptance
* Amendments and material changes
* Lender, title, and insurance coordination
* Closing readiness determinations
* Transaction milestones affecting closing or compliance

Transactions not recorded in RealEstate-OS will be treated as **non-compliant** for brokerage governance purposes.

---

## **IV. Closing Readiness Governance**

Closing readiness for any transaction shall be determined exclusively by RealEstate-OS based on:

* Verified transaction events
* Federated confirmations from lender, title, and insurance providers
* Enforced authority and role-based permissions

No individual agent, broker, or staff member may independently declare a transaction "clear to close" or equivalent status outside the system.

---

## **V. Automation and Human Authority**

RealEstate-OS may present automated recommendations or proposals related to transaction progression.

All such recommendations:

* Are advisory in nature
* Require human approval where applicable
* Do not replace professional judgment

Final authority remains with licensed professionals operating within system-enforced controls.

---

## **VI. Auditability and Record Integrity**

RealEstate-OS maintains a complete, immutable transaction history, including:

* Chronological event records
* Authority enforcement
* Federated third-party assertions
* Closing readiness determinations
* System-generated audit narratives

These records may be relied upon for:

* Internal compliance review
* Regulatory inquiries
* Legal proceedings
* Risk management and insurance purposes

---

## **VII. Agent and Staff Responsibilities**

All agents and staff are required to:

* Ensure transaction activity is accurately recorded in RealEstate-OS
* Follow system-enforced workflows and permissions
* Refrain from bypassing or duplicating transaction decisions outside the system
* Cooperate with brokerage compliance reviews conducted through the system

Failure to comply with this policy may result in corrective action under brokerage rules and applicable law.

---

## **VIII. Training and Support**

The brokerage will provide training and guidance on the proper use of RealEstate-OS.

Questions regarding this policy or system use should be directed to:

**[Designated Compliance Officer / Managing Broker]**

---

## **IX. Amendments and Review**

This policy may be amended from time to time to reflect regulatory changes, system enhancements, or brokerage governance needs.

---

### **Acknowledgment**

By conducting transactions under the authority of **[Brokerage Name]**, all agents and staff acknowledge and agree to comply with this policy.

---

**Approved by:**
[Managing Broker / Principal Broker Name]

**Title:**
[Title]

**Date:**
[Date]

## Usage Notes for Brokerage Leadership

### When to Issue This Policy

This policy should be issued **after successful completion of the shadow pilot** (Phase 1) and **executive adoption** (Phase 2).

Typical timing: 60-90 days after initial deployment.

### How to Communicate This Policy

1. **Managing broker meeting** — present rationale to leadership first
2. **Written distribution** — send to all agents with 30-day notice
3. **Training sessions** — offer hands-on guidance before enforcement
4. **Effective date** — clearly mark when mandate begins

### Expected Reactions

**Managing Brokers**: Relief (finally, clarity on deal status)
**Transaction Coordinators**: Support (reduces manual reconciliation)
**Top Agents**: Neutral to positive (protects them from liability)
**Resistant Agents**: May push back initially, but compliance is not optional

### Key Talking Points for Leadership

* *"This protects you, your clients, and the firm."*
* *"This is governance, not productivity software."*
* *"You still control your deals — we just track status correctly."*
* *"Regulators and courts will see this as a strength, not a burden."*

### Legal Review Recommendation

While this policy is designed for operational governance, brokerages should have it reviewed by legal counsel before adoption, particularly regarding:

* State real estate commission requirements
* Brokerage supervision obligations
* E&O insurance implications
* Employment/independent contractor considerations

---

## Modification Guide

Brokerages may customize this template for their specific needs, but should preserve:

* Clear designation of system of record
* Mandatory compliance language
* Authority enforcement principles
* Audit trail requirements

Avoid weakening language like "should" or "encouraged" — this is a **mandate**, not a suggestion.
