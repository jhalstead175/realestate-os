# Obsidian Reality Audio Specifications

## TRACK: "Glyph Resonance"

**Purpose:** Ambient soundscape for the Trinity birthing ceremony

**Technical Direction:**
- **Start:** Deep sub-bass hum (12 Hz) — barely audible, felt in chest
- **0:30:** Stone grinding texture (granular synthesis)
- **1:10:** Gold crackle (high-frequency glass-like fractures)
- **1:50:** Low-frequency chord progression (A minor, 32 Hz)
- **2:30:** Choir-like pad emerges (wordless, ethereal)
- **3:00:** All elements resolve to a single sustained tone (48 Hz)

**Duration:** 3:30

**Emotional Intent:**
Should feel like tectonic plates remembering they were one.

**File Format:**
- Primary: `resonance.mp3` (320kbps)
- Fallback: `resonance.ogg` (for broader browser support)

**Mixing Notes:**
- Sub-bass frequencies must be felt, not just heard
- Stone grinding should evoke ancient machinery awakening
- Gold crackle = moment of fusion, delicate but powerful
- Final sustained tone = the void holding its breath

**Integration:**
Used in `app/page.tsx` during GlyphFragments ceremony animation. Auto-plays on page load (user must witness the reunion).
