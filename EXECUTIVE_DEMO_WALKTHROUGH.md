# Enterprise Demo Script

## RealEstate-OS — 20-Minute Executive Walkthrough

---

## Purpose of the Demo

This demo is designed to answer **one question only**:

> *"Can this system tell us the truth about our transactions — clearly, calmly, and defensibly?"*

This is **not** a feature tour.
This is **not** an agent workflow demo.
This is a **governance demonstration**.

---

## Demo Audience

**Primary (must be present):**

* Broker-owner / Principal Broker
* Managing Broker
* COO / Ops Lead
* Compliance / Legal (if applicable)

**Not required:**

* Agents
* IT staff
* Marketing

---

## Demo Setup (Before the Call)

* Use **demo mode (synthetic data)**
* One brokerage
* 3–5 deals total
* At least:

  * 1 clean deal
  * 1 at-risk deal
  * 1 blocked deal

Have these tabs ready:

1. Deal Pipeline
2. Closing Readiness (blocked deal)
3. Automation Inbox
4. Audit Narrative Viewer
5. Metrics Dashboard

---

## Minute 0–2 — Opening Frame

**Say this (almost verbatim):**

> "Most real estate software helps agents work faster.
> RealEstate-OS helps brokerages know the truth about their transactions."

Pause.

> "This demo is about certainty, not productivity."

Do **not** open the UI yet.

---

## Minute 2–5 — Deal Pipeline (Reality Check)

**Screen:** Deal Pipeline

**Say:**

> "This is a read-only pipeline. Deals move stages only when real events occur."

Point out:

* Stage counts
* Readiness indicators

**Key line:**

> "No one can move a deal forward to make numbers look good."

Stop talking. Let them react.

---

## Minute 5–9 — Closing Readiness (The Moment)

**Screen:** Open the *blocked* deal's Closing Readiness page

Walk through:

* Red blocker
* Source (lender / title / insurance)
* Timestamp

**Say:**

> "The system is not optimistic. It's factual."

Then:

> "If this deal fails, we already know why."

This is where executives lean in.

---

## Minute 9–12 — Automation (Trust Test)

**Screen:** Automation Inbox

Show:

* A pending automation proposal
* Justification

**Say:**

> "Automation is not allowed to act on its own."

Then:

> "Nothing happens without human approval."

Optional:

* Approve or reject one proposal

**Key reassurance:**

> "The system can suggest. It cannot override judgment."

---

## Minute 12–15 — Audit Narrative (Credibility)

**Screen:** Audit Narrative Viewer

Scroll slowly.

Then click **Export PDF**.

**Say:**

> "If a regulator or attorney asked what happened here, this is the answer we give."

Pause.

> "And it's generated automatically from the system of record."

Let that land.

---

## Minute 15–17 — Metrics (Executive Value)

**Screen:** Metrics Dashboard

Point out:

* On-time close rate
* Time-to-close variance
* Vendor bottlenecks

**Say:**

> "This is what your brokerage actually experiences — not what it hopes."

This reframes the entire business.

---

## Minute 17–19 — Mobile Agent View (Calm)

**Screen:** Mobile Deal Summary or Timeline

**Say:**

> "Agents can check their deal in under five seconds — and they can't accidentally break anything."

This reduces resistance instantly.

---

## Minute 19–20 — Close

**Say this exactly:**

> "We don't ask brokerages to change how they work on day one."
>
> "We run quietly alongside your existing tools."
>
> "And we show you the truth."

Then:

> "If you want, the next step is a 30-day shadow pilot with 10–25 deals."

Stop.

Do **not** pitch pricing unless asked.

---

## Questions You Should Invite

* "What happens when a deal fails?"
* "Can agents bypass this?"
* "What do regulators see?"
* "How does this coexist with our CRM?"

Avoid answering questions they haven't asked.

---

## Demo Success Criteria

A successful demo ends with one of these statements:

* "We've never seen our deals this clearly."
* "This would have saved us last quarter."
* "This answers questions we usually argue about."

If you hear any of those — you're in.

---

## Final Reminder

This demo is not about excitement.

It's about **relief**.

Relief is what executives buy.
